# My experience in The Racoons hackathon 2023

To start off, this was a hackathon hosted by the Latvia University Computer Faculty student council with the support of 
sponsors and partners. While it was meant for high school and university students, there were others "of age" there 
that participated.

## The experience in the event outside of hacking

The food at the venue was plenty but the location could have been better as the nearest large store was quite a bit 
away, that staff were amazing to us (the participants) and the judges and mentors were very friendly. Sadly (or luckily)
my group didn't have much use for the mentors but when they came up to ask how our project was coming along they were 
very friendly and saw that we weren't running in to much trouble. The other participants seemed friendly enough, except 
for one man (seemingly in his 30s or 40s) who kept bothering my teammates to come smoke with him and seemed drunk after 
the first night.

## The project

Now to the juicy part. Me and my team initially were aiming for the Sustainability and Data challenge, but since we were 
running in to a wall with how boring all of our idea were, we switched to game dev and started making "Mental Chess", as 
the challenge specified of focusing on mental health awareness.

### The proposal

I proposed this idea "Since we all play chess to some level and enjoy the game, lets create a superset of chess rules 
that give the game a bit of new charm and raise awareness about the impacts of mental illness", and after some talk about 
the proposed rules we got to work, one of my teammates got to work creating the basic website in react and a small 
backend to handle the websocket connection between players, the other (Gustavs) got to work making the pixel art for the 
chess pieces, and i worked on the new rule set and design ideas.
